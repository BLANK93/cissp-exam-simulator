Visual inventory relies on staff checking items, MAC addresses are hardware addresses for networked devices, and not every asset in inventory is likely to have a wireless network capabilityâor to be on!

More critical devices like routers and core switches are typically equipped with redundant power supplies to ensure that larger segments of the network do not fail if a component fails. Of course, making sure devices are supported so they get updates and that they are under warranty are both common practices for supportable networks.",

That means that telemetry dataâinformation about what components are doingâis critical and will be gathered using logs, metrics, and real-time analysis. This means that centralizing and aggregating data, enabling alerts for critical errors, and implementing logging using standardized formats are all common practices. Feedback loops are also important, allowing administrators and others to take action when problems or issues are detected.",

Segmentation can also help provide security by separating functional groups that don't need to be able to access each other's systems. Installing a firewall at the border would only help with inbound and outbound traffic, not cross-network traffic. Spanning tree loop prevention helps prevent loops in Ethernet networks (for example, when you plug a switch into a switch via two ports on each), but it won't solve broadcast storms that aren't caused by a loop or security issues. Encryption might help prevent some problems between functional groups, but it won't stop them from scanning other systems, and it definitely won't stop a broadcast storm!",

An IPS might detect an attacker's redirect, but tracking the multitude of load-balanced servers most large providers use can be challenging, if not impossible.

Pass-the-hash attacks rely on sniffed or otherwise acquired NTLM or LanMan hashes being sent to a system to avoid the need to know a user's password.

The cards and keys are an example of a Type 2 factor, or âsomething you have.â Using a smart card replaces this with another Type 2 factor, but the cards could still be loaned out or stolen. Adding a PIN would address the problem by adding a second authentication factor, but PINs may be written down and are prone to theft or even guessing for shorter PINs, so a biometric factor is preferable if it is available. Adding cameras doesn't prevent access to the facility and thus doesn't solve the immediate problem (but it is a good idea!).",

In this case, a consistent time difference often indicates that one system uses local time, and the other is using Greenwich mean time (GMT). Logs from multiple sources tend to cause problems with centralization and collection, whereas different log formats can create challenges in parsing log data.

		"Mutual assistance agreement",
		"Business partnership agreement"
	],
	"correctAnswer": [
		"Resource capacity agreement"
	],
	"explanation": "A resource capacity agreement is the most appropriate for Chas's concern, as it specifically addresses the availability of resources in a disaster scenario. This type of agreement ensures that the cloud provider has sufficient resources to meet the needs of their clients, even in the event of multiple simultaneous disasters. It directly tackles the issue of resource allocation and availability, which is Chas's primary concern. In contrast, a nondisclosure agreement is more about confidentiality and doesn't address resource capacity. A mutual assistance agreement typically involves agreements between organizations for support during emergencies but doesn't guarantee specific resource availability. A business partnership agreement is broader and may not specifically cover the detailed aspects of resource availability in disaster scenarios.",

For example, they might use high-voltage electricity, high or low temperature, or other factors to cause a malfunction that undermines the security of the device. Side-channel attacks seek to use information about system activity and retrieve information that is actively being encrypted. Brute-force attacks attempt every possible valid combination for a key or password. In a timing attack, the attacker measures precisely how long cryptographic operations take to complete, gaining information about the cryptographic process that may be used to undermine its security.",

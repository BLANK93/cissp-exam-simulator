This might involve tampering with hardware before the customer receives it or using social engineering to compromise a vendor employee. Hacking into a web server run in an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environment is not a supply chain risk because the web server is already under the control of the customer. Using a botnet to conduct a denial-of-service attack does not involve any supply chain elements.",
